# Local WordCamp Sponsorship

WordCamps are a great opportunity for companies that benefit from a free and open source software like WordPress to give back to the project that’s given them so much. Many companies are built around WordPress. A company that sponsors might have a lot of customers who love WordPress; other companies might just use WordPress, love it, and want to give back.

## WordCamp sponsorship packages

Setting up your local sponsorship packages can be a challenge. Not everyone is accustomed to fundraising, and some organizers develop a nasty case of [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) when they start looking at how to acknowledge companies that give their event a chunk of cash to help make WordCamp happen. The WordCamp program has an established set of sponsorship rules, which apply to your event. So how do you set up WordCamp sponsorship packages that show gratitude to your sponsors but don’t give away the store?

We’ve assembled some common WordCamp sponsor acknowledgement methods that are appropriate, respectful of attendees, and easy for your volunteer organizing team to follow through on.  Mix and match to create your own packages\*!

*   Logo on the site
*   Company description on the site
*   Thanks in a blog post thanking all sponsors just before the event
*   Tickets (reserved and/or complimentary) for company representatives of the sponsor
*   A certain number of items on the self-serve swag table
*   Logo on slide projected between presentations
*   Tweet(s) and/or posts to Facebook (etc) thanking the sponsor
*   Logo on name badge (good for the top package)
*   Thanks in pre- and/or post-event emails (good for the top package)
*   Thank you in opening or closing remarks (good for the top package)
*   A table at the event in a high traffic area (good for the top package)

\*You don’t have to use all of them! Really!

In general, sponsors are not looking for a laundry list of perks, they want to support WordCamp and WordPress.  Offering space for your top sponsors to connect with the attendees is generally the most desirable benefit, but not a requirement. Certainly attendees should never be inconvenienced by sponsor acknowledgement, and WordCamps never provide a speaker slot or attendee information to sponsors.
