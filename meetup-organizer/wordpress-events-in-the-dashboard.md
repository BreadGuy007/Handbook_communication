### I belong to a WordPress meetup group, and our events don’t show up on the widget! Is it broken?

Only groups that are part of the WordPress meetup chapter program are listed on the widget. If your local group’s events aren’t showing up, it’s possible that it just hasn’t joined the chapter program yet! Joining is free, and requires following a few good-faith rules that were created by a group of volunteer meetup organizers. Information on joining the WordPress meetup program can be found [here](https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/).

### What information is collected, and what is it used for?

The plugin sends each user’s timezone, locale, and partially anonymized IP address to api.wordpress.orgWordPress.org The community site where WordPress code is created and shared by the users. This is where you can download the source code for WordPress core, plugins and themes as well as the central location for community conversations and organization. [https://wordpress.org/](https://wordpress.org/), in order to determine their location, so that they can be shown events that are close to that location. If the user requests events near a specific city, then that is also sent. The data is not stored permanently, not used for any other purpose, and not shared with anyone outside of WordPress.org, with the exception of any conditions covered in the [WordPress.org privacy policy](https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/).

### How to debug functionality and report a bug?

*Following instructions and details are bit developer orientated. If you don’t feel comfortable with code and technical terms, the [#community-events](https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/community-events/)* [*Slack*](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) *channel is the place to get help and report problems with WordPress Events functionality.*  

Before submitting a bug report, please check that you are not in a local development environment and expecting Events APIAPI An API or Application Programming Interface is a software intermediary that allows programs to interact with each other and share data in limited, clearly defined ways. to detect your location. That will not work, since location detection can’t be done with IP address of local environment. Currently, the ip2location database is used as the source for detection and the data is updated oncea month.  

On the Dashboard side, the Events widget saves a few database records to store necessary data. One is \`community-events-location\` inside \`wp\_usermeta\`, which stores either the location detected or the location manually set by each user. The other record is a transient to store the cached event data. That transient is shared across users, so if you have 500 users, but they’re all in Seattle, then there will only be 1 transient to cache the events for all of them.  

If you are availabe to add plugins and read error logs, add this plugin to your \`mu-plugins\` [https://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/41217/log-community-events-requests.php](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/41217/log-community-events-requests.php). It will give you the exact api.wordpress.org/events URLURL A specific web address of a website or web page on the Internet, such as a website’s URL www.wordpress.org that is being queried, making it easier to troubleshoot parameters.
