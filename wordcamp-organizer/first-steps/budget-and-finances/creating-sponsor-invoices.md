### Add New Sponsor Invoice

> Important! For amounts under $250 USD or equivalent, please [create a microsponsor ticket](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/web-presence/using-camptix-event-ticketing-plugin/#creating-tickets) instead, to reduce our administrative burden. Thanks!

1.  Locate the Budget menu on the left side of your WordCamp site, then select Sponsor Invoices.
2.  Click ‚ÄúAdd New‚Äù button:

3.  Enter¬†the title of your Invoice as \[Sponsor Level\] Sponsorship
    *   Example¬†‚ÄúGold Level Sponsorship‚Äù
    *   (The name of your WordCamp and the sponsor will auto-populate on the invoice.)
4.  Select the name of the sponsor you‚Äôre invoicing in the dropdown list labeled ‚ÄúSponsor‚Äù. If you have not yet saved to draft a Sponsor post for this company as detailed above, you can use the ‚ÄúAdd New Sponsor‚Äù link (next to the drop-down list) before creating the invoice.[![Sponsor dropdown](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2016/02/Sponsor-dropdown-300x213.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2016/02/Sponsor-dropdown.png)
5.  Select the name of your¬†WordCamp‚Äôs city¬†in the dropdown list labeled ‚ÄúCommunity‚Äù  
    [![Community Dropdown](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2016/02/5Untitled-300x293.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2016/02/5Untitled.png)
    *   Take care to select the correct location¬†if you share a name with a different city (Manhattan, KS vs Manhattan, NY; Lancaster, PA vs Lancaster, UK; etc).
6.  Enter the description of the¬†Sponsorship level ‚Äî this will appear on your invoice above the payment instructions.
7.  Select currency that the invoice should be created in.

    *   This should be the currency the sponsor will be using to pay the invoice and won‚Äôt necessarily be the same as the currency your WordCamp is using. If you aren‚Äôt sure, definitely ask!
8.  Enter amount we should invoice to the sponsor.

    *   Just like before, we ask for no thousands separators or currency symbols. See the image above for an example.
9.  Send Invoice  
    [![Send Invoice](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2016/02/8Edit-Invoice-%E2%80%B9-WordCamp-Testing-2014-%E2%80%94-WordPress.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2016/02/8Edit-Invoice-%E2%80%B9-WordCamp-Testing-2014-%E2%80%94-WordPress.png)
    *   Make sure everything is correct before you¬†send the invoice for approval. You can also save it as a draft if you are missing information.
    *   Once you‚Äôve sent the invoice for approval, it cannot be edited unless it‚Äôs marked incomplete.

And in case you‚Äôre wondering where all these pieces of information go, we‚Äôve included an Example Sponsor invoice¬†complete with labels. üôÇ

### Checking Sponsor Invoice Status

Just like with the vendor payment requests, each invoice will have a different status that will help you track its progress. From the Sponsor Invoice page, you‚Äôll be able to see all the invoices together¬†with their individual statuses shown at the end of the invoice title (circled on the image below). You can also see invoices grouped by status using the links at the top (shown in a red box on the image below).
