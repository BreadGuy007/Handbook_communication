# Application Process

> **tl;dr:** Apply to organize [here](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/become-an-organizer/organizer-application/ "Organizer Application"). We’ll reply, probably by requesting an interview or suggesting you start a local meetup first. If your team is brand new to WordCamp organizing, apply about 6 months from your target event date.

Due to the phenomenal growth in WordCamps around the world, we ask that you please not begin organizing a WordCamp until you’ve contacted us and been approved as an organizer for your city, as there may already be a WordCamp there in the planning stages.

To get started, please fill out the [Organizer Application](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/become-an-organizer/organizer-application/ "Organizer Application"). Your answers to these 20-ish questions will enable us to provide you with the best resources and/or connect you with other people in your location already in the process of planning a local WordCamp.

First-time WordCamp organizing teams are asked to apply and start the pre-planning process no more than about 6 months before their desired event date. Experience has shown that teams new to WordCamp organizing are best able to create and maintain momentum within a 4-6 month planning window. Learn more by looking over this [WordCamp Planning Milestones schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1780h9E5srRKGVAP0ppYhUARqY6ln787M1mcEiIQw8i0/edit#gid=0).

After we’ve reviewed your application, we will get back to you with one of the following:

*   Approval to move forward, discussion of expectations, and a call to discuss your plans.
*   A recommendation to start with a meetup group first to grow the community and/or identify and recuit co-organizers to help, and then recontact us in a few months if it is successful.
*   A kind but firm answer that it’s not a good fit based on your responses to the application questions. If you think we misunderstood you, let us know and we can discuss it further.

Once you’re approved as an organizer, WordCamp Central will get you set up with a site on wordcamp.org for your event and provide a budget worksheet for you to fill out. Once your budget is approved, you can publish your site and announce your dates. Additional information and support will also be provided to get your event going.

Thanks for your interest, and good luck!
