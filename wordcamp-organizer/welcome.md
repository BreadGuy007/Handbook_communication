WordCamps are casual, locally-organized conferences that focus on everything WordPress. Each WordCamp is different, reflecting the local WordPress community it represents, but usually a wide range of people from casual users to core developers participate, share ideas, and get to know each other.

This site is a handbook for WordCamp organizers. Because WordCamps are approved by the WordPress Foundation, each event — though unique — follows some basic guidelines and standards, to ensure that WordCamp attendees know [what to expect](http://central.wordcamp.org/what-to-expect/) when attending [a WordCamp near them](http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/).

It’s important to note that these guidelines have been developed in response to feedback from WordPress community members; as WordPress becomes more popular than ever (over 35 million users at last count), it’s become necessary to be more careful when granting permission to use the trademark in order to prevent confusion about what sites, companies, people, and events are officially part of the WordPress project. When people see an event on WordCamp.org, they know it can be trusted to live up to their expectations and accurately represent WordPress.

In addition to laying out the requirements for approval, this site provides guidance regarding the tasks and decisions common to many WordCamps. Tips and examples are taken from the experiences of past organizers, and more will be added as they are submitted.
