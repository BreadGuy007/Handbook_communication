# Become an Organizer

In this section, we cover what it takes to get approved as a WordCamp organizer. Note that we usually approve one primary organizer, and it is then up to that person to put together an appropriate team of co-organizers. Occasionally we’ll get applications from multiple people at the same time for the same city, and we’ll ask them to work together. In that case, you usually will still need to put together a bigger organizing team, and should elect one person to be the primary organizer/main point of contact for WordCamp Central.

It is generally considered that ongoing meetup groups are the lifeblood of the local WordPress community, and that WordCamps are their annual celebrations. If there is an active meetup group in your city but you do not participate, it is unlikely you will be approved as the primary organizer of the annual event, so you should start attending the meetups first. If there is no meetup group yet, you will probably be prompted to try and start one. Being able to get 20-30 people together over a shared love of WordPress will give us more confidence that you can bring together a bigger community at WordCamp.
