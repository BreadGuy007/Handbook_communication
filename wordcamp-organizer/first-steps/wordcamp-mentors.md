# WordCamp Mentors

The mentorship program is a great way for every WordCamp organizer to get structured support and guidance.

OnceÂ youâ€™ve been approved as a WordCamp organizer, please send a request to [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org) with the following information so that we can process your mentorship request in a timely manner:

*   Subject: \[WordCamp YOUR\_LOCATIONÂ YEAR\_OF\_EVENT\] WordCamp Mentorship Request
*   Your Name
*   WordCamp Location
*   Month/Year of your WordCamp event
*   Number of years organizing
*   Previous mentor (if applicable)

You should then be connected with a mentor through an email introduction.

The format weâ€™ve been using has been to ask groups/pairs to meet every two weeks for the duration ofÂ your WordCamp planning, and then talking as often as necessary outside that schedule for ease of mind and all that. ðŸ™‚ Please be prepared to discuss your current planning status with your mentor and have a list of questionsÂ ready to ask if applicable prior to your scheduled meeting times.

Your mentor will be your first point ofÂ contact with questionsÂ that come up. Their involvement should be one of advisement on procedure and sharing of knowledge based on their history organizing WordCamps. Mentors are not to be considered one of your planning team and should not assign themselves or be assigned any actual planning tasks.

As always, [@andreamiddleton](https://profiles.wordpress.org/andreamiddleton/),Â [@camikaos](https://profiles.wordpress.org/camikaos/), [@rocio](https://profiles.wordpress.org/rocio/), [@chanthaboune](https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/), [@courtneypk](https://profiles.wordpress.org/courtneypk/),Â and the rest of the volunteers at WordCamp Central will still be available for tricky questions in the [#events](https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/events-2/) channel on WordPress Slack, but weâ€™re hoping to make peer mentoring our first line of awesomeness for WordCamp organizers.

If you have any questions about the mentorship program, pleaseÂ send us an email at [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org).
