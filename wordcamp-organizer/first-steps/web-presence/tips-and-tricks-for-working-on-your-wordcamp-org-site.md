# Tips and Tricks for Working on Your WordCamp.org site

## Adding Users

To add a user to your WordCamp.org site, you must know the email address associated with the user’s WordPress.org username. This is the account that someone would use to log on to [WordPress.org support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/bb-login.php), for example. If you don’t remember the details of your WordPress.org account, you can send yourself a [password recovery email](https://wordpress.org/support/bb-login.php). If you don’t have a WordPress.org account, you can get one [here](https://wordpress.org/support/register.php).

If you know the email address associated with the user’s WordPress.org account, simply choose Add Existing from the Users tab to add the user by entering the email address associated with the person’s WordPress.org account.

## Contact Forms

There are a variety of things that can go wrong with contact forms, and especially e-mail, so it’s a good idea to periodically test out the forms to make sure you’re receiving them. If you suspect someone filled out a form, but you never received an e-mail, you can check the Feedback screen in WordPress to view them directly from the database.

## Building Community with WordCamp Content

Obviously all WordCamp sites include a call for speakers, volunteers, and sponsors, a schedule, registration page, sponsor shout-outs, etc. But we all know that publishing more content will bring more people to your site, and thus — ideally — to your event. Here are some ideas for articles you can publish to foster community engagement:

*   We’re looking for a venue (include the requirements you have) – leave us a comment if you have a suggestion.
*   What do you want to learn at WordCamp?
*   Nominate a speaker for WordCamp!
*   We’re considering caterers for lunch! What’s the best or worst lunch you’ve ever had at a conference in Awesome Town?
*   Tell us about a connection you made — met someone for the first time or met someone in-person that you only knew online — at a previous WordCamp.
*   What kind of swag do you like? (t-shirt, pint glass, travel mug, hoodie, fedora, etc)
*   Watch videos from past WordCamps.
*   Volunteers wanted! (with “job” descriptions)
*   Here are some places we’re considering for our after-party; vote or suggest an alternative!
*   Stories from organizers or speakers about great experiences they had at WordCamp
*   Articles from speakers about the subject of their sessions

## Additional Plugins

Most of the plugins that are available on WordCamp.org will already be activated on your site, but there are a few that are are disabled by default, because most camps don’t need them. If you’d like to have any of them activated, just email support@wordcamp.org.
