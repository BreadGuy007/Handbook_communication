Diversity Speaker Training Workshop
===================================

Have you ever had trouble getting women and other underrepresented groups to speak at your meetups and WordCamps?

Check out the Diversity Outreach Speaker Training workshop: [https://make.wordpress.org/training/speaker-training](https://make.wordpress.org/training/speaker-training)

Variations of this workshop have been run in Vancouver, Seattle, Portland, Montréal, New York City, Toronto, and Brighton, and all had a significant increase in the number of WordCamp speakers who identify as women. Vancouver and Montreal for example have had at least 50% for 3 years in a row, and in 2017 Seattle had the highest ratio so far, with 60% women speakers.

The global community team has a working group available to train people to run the workshop and provide the materials, and we want to hear from you! To let us know if you’re interested in conducting this workshop in your community, please fill in this form:
