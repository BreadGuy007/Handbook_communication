<p>We are reserving use of the paid online production tools for WordCamps. For meetups (and other smaller events), there are many excellent, free tools to use. <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/resources/organizing-virtual-events/">We have a list of suggested tools, along with tips and ideas from community organizers here</a>.</p>

<p>All new online WordCamps, along with existing online WordCamps that did not complete a budget review (as on August 2020),  will need to rely on local sponsorship if they wish to work with A/V production vendors. If these camps are not relying on A/V vendors, they can still host the WordCamp using accessible tools (such as YouTube live, Zoom, and Streamyard for example) with the help of local volunteers. </p>

<p><em>Note: WordCamp Central had previously provided Audio Visual vendor support for online WordCamps that were held in the first half of 2020. WordCamp organizers had the option to make use of the recommended vendors or choose to work with a local supplier. You can find more background on this change <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/23/moving-forward-with-online-events/">in the following blog post</a>.</em></p>
