Organize Learn WordPress Discussion groups for your WordPress Meetup

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meetup organizers can use the <a href="https://learn.wordpress.org/">Learn WordPress</a> content for their meetup events – simply ask your meetup group to watch one of the workshops in the weeks leading up to your scheduled event, and then host a discussion group content event.</p>

<p>If you are interested, you can start right away by <a href="https://learn.wordpress.org/workshops/">organizing a discussion group based on one of the available workshops</a> for your meetup group. You don’t need to sign up as a discussion group leader to organize a workshop for your local meetup. Here’s how you can get started:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Take a look at the available workshops in <a href="https://learn.wordpress.org/">Learn WordPress</a> and select one for your meetup group. If you want, you can seek help from other group members in finalizing a workshop for the discussion group.&nbsp;</li><li>Once you have identified a workshop for your local meetup group, schedule a discussion event in your Meetup.com group. Specify in the Meetup description that this is a discussion group connected to a workshop, and ask meetup group members to watch the workshop video before attending the workshop. Make sure that you plan the event at least a week ahead from the current date, so that your meetup members have enough time to view the workshop before participating in the discussion group.&nbsp;</li><li>Send a message to your Meetup group members announcing the meetup. Encourage them to see the Learn WordPress workshop video, and request them to participate in the discussion group.</li><li>Organize the discussion group at the date and time. Start the discussion group by asking members about how many of them saw the workshop. You can start by providing a very brief (5-10 minute long) summary of the content. Then, ask questions to members, and try to start a discussion. You can consider innovating - some tips include organizing a quiz towards the end of the session or containing exercises as part of the meetup event.</li></ol>
