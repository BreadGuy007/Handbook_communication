<p>An important part of the WordCamp program is our sponsors. Their importance to every WordCamp should be recognized, so this page contains  some ideas for sponsor recognition that you could use for your online WordCamp!</p>

<p><strong>All organizers will need to have your sponsorship packages approved by a Community Team deputy during their budget review.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When fundraising for essential expenses, if online booths are included as a sponsor benefit, it’s still going to be important to clearly differentiate between sponsor “spaces” and community event “spaces.” Intermingling the two is confusing for attendees, so all organizing teams should avoid listing sponsor-generated content in a way that implies that it’s part of the event’s main schedule.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Below are some ideas for benefits that you can offer to your sponsors. Feel free to pick and choose from these suggestions!</p>
