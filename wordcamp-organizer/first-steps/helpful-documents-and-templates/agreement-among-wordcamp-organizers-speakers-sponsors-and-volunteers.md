# Agreement among WordCamp Organizers, Speakers, Sponsors, and Volunteers

1.  I agree that WordCamps are meant to benefit the local WordPress community through live events and the broader WordPress community through the sharing of online video and other materials.
2.  I agree that a WordCamp is a casual, locally- and volunteer-organized event, focused on WordPress and reflecting the local WordPress community it represents.
3.  I understand that WordCamp organizers, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers are expected to support the WordPress project and its principles.
4.  I understand that the principles of the WordPress project include:
    *   no discrimination on the basis of economic or social status, race, color, ethnic origin, national origin, creed, religion, political belief, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, age, or disability
    *   no incitement to violence or promotion of hate
    *   no spammers
    *   no jerks
    *   respect the WordPress trademark
    *   embrace the WordPress license; If distributing WordPress-derivative works (themes, plugins, WP distros), any person or business officially associated with WordCamp should give their users the same freedoms that WordPress itself provides: 100% GPL or compatible, the same guidelines we follow on WordPress.org.
    *   don’t promote companies or people that violate the trademark or distribute WordPress derivative works which aren’t 100% GPL compatible
5.  I agree that WordCamps are not-for-profit events, organized with budget and funding transparency.
6.  I agree that WordCamps should be accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of financial status.
7.  I agree to safeguard the sensitive personal data collected and stored on WordCamp.org, according to [the WordPress.org privacy policy](https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/).
8.  I understand that data recording my participation as WordCamp organizer, speaker, sponsor, and/or volunteer will be retained indefinitely, to preserve the history of the WordPress open source project.
9.  I agree that I am not an employee of the WordPress Foundation or any subsidiary of the Foundation, and am participating in WordCamp exclusively as a volunteer.

### Sponsor agreements

Most sponsors will not need a sponsor agreement, but there are some cases when one is required.
