# Global Sponsorship program for 2017

This page has information for companies interested in sponsoring WordPress community events through the Global Community Sponsorship program. If you are an event organizer looking for more information about global sponsors or the global community program in general, please check out [Global Community Sponsorship — For Event Organizers](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/planning-details/fundraising/global-community-sponsorship-for-event-organizers/) in the WordCamp Organizing Handbook.

### Sponsoring Community Events

Thanks for your interest in supporting the WordPress community via event sponsorship! We’re so grateful to our sponsors, because without them we couldn’t put on the events that help our community connect and grow.

When you sponsor an official WordPress event, you’re not giving money in exchange for marketing/advertising at the event or with the attendee audience. Sponsorships are donations, given to support the WordPress open source project.

There are two ways to sponsor: through the Global Community program, or through direct sponsorship of individual events.

### **WordPress Global Community Sponsorship in 2017  
**

One out of every four websites is powered by WordPress, the free and open source software built and maintained by thousands of volunteers all over the world. The WordPress contributor community is made up of developers, designers, writers, photographers, freelancers, agency professionals, and hobbyists, many of whom gather regularly around the world at locally-organized monthly and annual events. Official WordPress community events are exclusively volunteer-organized, and each reflects the interests and expertise of the local community. In 2016, there were 2,698 meetings of official WordPress meetup groups and 115 local annual conferences, which we call [WordCamps](https://central.wordcamp.org/about/).

#### **What’s a WordCamp?**

WordCamp is the annual conference for local WordPress communities; it’s a casual, non-commercial, educational event about WordPress. Events range from intimate 50-person unconferences to multi-track conferences attended by over 1,000. Conference session topics include WordPress development, design, business, social media integration, blogging, and marketing. WordCamp tickets are sold at an extremely low price ($20 per person, per day) so that events are accessible to people of any financial background.  
In 2016, there were 62 WordCamps in the Western region (up from 50 in 2015) and 51 WordCamps in the Eastern region (up from 34 in 2015).

#### **What’s a meetup?**

WordPress meetups are locally-organized user groups that get together for face-to-face events on a regular basis to discuss WordPress (commonly once a month). These events take many formats: presentations/lecture series, hackathons, social gatherings, workshops, coworking, running a WordPress help desk, contributor sprints/drives, and others. Groups hosted on meetup.com can join an official WordPress account and receive financial and organizational support from the WordPress Community team.

#### **How does event sponsorship help WordPress?**

Companies that sponsor WordPress community events support the WordPress open source project by helping our volunteer-organized, local events provide free or low-cost access for attendees. WordPress community events strengthen, inspire, and connect the community that builds and maintains WordPress.

### **Why sponsor via this program rather than sponsoring individual events?**

As the WordPress community continues to grow, many companies find they don’t have time to coordinate with multiple teams of volunteer event organizers. The WordPress Global Community Sponsorship Program ensures that your support reaches WordCamps and meetups quickly and provides stability to locally-organized events. WordPress global community sponsors have a single, centralized point of contact and are billed quarterly, saving companies time and trouble. Global community sponsors are emailed as soon as each WordCamp is added to the official schedule with all the vital details for the event, including contact info for the organizing team, anticipated number of attendees, mailing address for swag, and more.  Global sponsor company information is pre-loaded on every WordCamp website by WordCamp Central, so the local organizing team can publish the sponsor’s logo and company description with one simple click.
