# Banners and Flyers

Help your attendees understand the many different ways to get involved with WordPress. Teams are explained on [https://make.wordpress.org](https://make.wordpress.org) but for visualizing them with banners at your WordCamp or having flyers on the tables, start with the resources below:

*   5.5×8.5 inch flyer/postcard (two on a Letter-sized page) with no bleeds (this is usually easier to print on home printers or at copy shops) – [PDF](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2018/03/WordPress-GetInvolved-2up.pdf)
*   5×7 inch postcard with bleeds (good to send to print shops since the print bleeds off the edge) – [PDF](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2017/09/WordPress-GetInvolved-5x7-PRINT.pdf)
*   Complete archive of .ai , .indd and pdf files are available here – [ZIP](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2017/09/get-involved-source-files-1.zip)
*   The [icons](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2017/09/get-involved-icons.zip) are available in svg format

If you want to add translations for your language, follow these steps:

*   Check if the Get-Involved text has been already translated into your language on[ https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/meta/get-involved](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/meta/get-involved)
*   If not, propose translations and/or get in contact with your translation team on [https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/)
*   Let us know on slack in the [community-team](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/community-team) channel if you have created any in your language so we can centralize them!

All teams follow the color coding as defined by the meta team on [https://make.wordpress.org/meta/handbook/documentation/profile-badges/](https://make.wordpress.org/meta/handbook/documentation/profile-badges/)
