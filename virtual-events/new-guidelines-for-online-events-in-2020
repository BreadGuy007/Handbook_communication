# New Guidelines for Online Events in 2020

# 2020年内におけるオンラインイベントの新ガイドライン

<!--
Just like all in-person events, anyone involved in an official role for your WordCamp, Meetup, do_action, or any other WordPress community event is representing WordPress. For online events, we have the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/become-an-organizer/representing-wordpress/">same expectations for those organizers, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers</a>.

他の対面イベントと同様に、WordCamp、Meetup、do_action、その他のWordPressコミュニティイベントで公式な役割を担う人は、WordPressを代表していることになります。オンラインイベントの場合も、<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/become-an-organizer/representing-wordpress/">主催者、講演者、スポンサー、ボランティアには、同様に期待が寄せられています</a>。

In order to facilitate successful community events during this global emergency, we have adapted some of our existing community guidelines to promote online community events for 2020.

この世界的な緊急事態の間にコミュニティイベントを成功させるために、2020年におけるオンラインでのコミュニティイベントを促進するために、既存のコミュニティガイドラインの一部を適応させました。

1. Regional/country WordCamps, Meetups, do_action events. We strongly believe that there is much value in local, in-person events, and intend to maintain this guideline when we can all meet in person again safely. During this time, however, we will approve country/regional events as long as the major meetup groups are involved in the organizing process.

2. Reduce the budget review process for WordCamps. Online WordCamps cost much less than in-person events. The WordPress Community team has identified vendors who will help produce online events, and online WordCamps will be offering free tickets. Because of these factors, it is now possible to “fast track” budget reviews! Read more about online WordCamp cost guidelines or the budget review process here.

3. Shorter planning periods for community events. An online event tends to be faster to organize. Organizers can propose the date of their event, allowing for enough time between orientation and the event to find speakers, volunteers, and market the event.

We hope to go back to in-person gatherings with original guidelines for planning community events as soon as we can, as our in-person program has proven to empower more community leaders across a large number of local communities and to reach more people within those areas.
