# Inclusive and welcoming events

WordCamp organizers are expected to prioritize inclusion and diversity by creating a 100% welcoming atmosphere at WordCamp and actively recruiting diverse organizers, speakers, and volunteers. For people who are not sure how to meet this expectations, here are a few articles that we think might be helpful:

[Sexualized environments](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/FLOSS#Sexualized_environment)

[Harassment](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/FLOSS#Harrassment_incidents) (Even if you know not to harass people, it‚Äôs good to read through some examples of harassment incidents to understand how they happened. Most people don‚Äôt wake up in the morning and think, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to harass someone today!‚Äù)

## Requests for special accommodations:

Occasionally, an attendee will require that special accommodations be made so they can fully participate in WordCamp. This is usually brought to the organizing team‚Äôs attention when the person registers for WordCamp.

In the case of deaf or hard of hearing attendees, the organizing team should email the attendee to find out what kind of assistance they require. Some event teams provide [CART services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_access_real-time_translation), while some arrange for sign language interpreters to accompany the attendee during the event.

If the attendee has a friend or friends who is willing to interpret for them, the volunteer interpreters should be given free tickets to the event. Interpreters who are hired through a service should also be given free tickets to the event so they can stay with the deaf or hard of hearing attendee throughout the event. If your WordCamp includes any official parties, mixers, networking events, etc, find out which ‚Äúside events‚Äù the attendee plans to attend and arrange for interpreters to accompany the attendee for those hours as well. Be sure to post the ending time of all parties so that it‚Äôs clear when the ‚ÄúWordCamp portion‚Äù of the gathering is complete.

The global community team can help WordCamps with an additional accessibility grant to cover the expenses related to special accommodation requests if necessary.

If you need help or have questions about responding to a request for special accommodations, email support@wordcamp.org ‚Äî members of the global community team have lots of experience with these requests. üôÇ
