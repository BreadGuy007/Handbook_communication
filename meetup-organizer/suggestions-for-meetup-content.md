Ways to make these talks work for you. [#Ways to make these talks work for you.](#ways-to-make-these-talks-work-for-you)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Full-Length Presentation [#Full-Length Presentation](#full-length-presentation)

30 minutes, followed by a Question and Answer period. This is great for a deep dive into any topic. Try to mix up the type of talks each month.

This is great way for speakers who have experience talking to jump in, but newcomers also always have something valuable to say. It’s also a great way for a speaker to try out something that they want to pitch to an upcoming WordCamp, and get feedback on what to revise.

### Lightning Presentation [#Lightning Presentation](#lightning-presentation)

10 Minutes followed by a Question and Answer: The Q & A can take place either right away or after several lightning talks.

This is a great way to make sure topics stay focused. It also keeps interest in the meeting if the main talk is from more of a technical angle and the lightning talk is more from a user angle or vice versa.

### Super Lightning [#Super Lightning](#super-lightning)

5 Minute Presentation: Questions at Happiness Session at the end of the evening  
This is essentially a top tips type of presentation. It moves super fast.

It’s also a great way for new speakers or new members of your Meetup to feel comfortable speaking. It’s low pressure.
