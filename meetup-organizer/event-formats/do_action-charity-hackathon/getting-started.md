<!-- **So you want to organise your own do_action event? Great – welcome on board!** -->
**ではあなたは do_action イベントを主催したいということですね？ 素晴らしい - ようこそ!**

Fortunately for you, [the doaction.org website](http://doaction.org/) is designed to take a lot of the heavy-lifting off your shoulders, so you can focus on the practical aspects of the event, rather than the manual admin tasks.

We will go over all of this in more detail in the rest of these handbook pages, but the ingredients you need for a successful do_action event are the following:

*   An active [local WordPress meetup](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/)
*   A venue (and date)
*   A selection of local non-profit organisations
*   Willing participants from your local community
*   Catering
*   Sponsors

_That’s it!_

The rest of these handbook pages deal with the specifics of how all of those things work, so use the links in the menu on the side and you’ll soon be on your way to your first local do_action event.
