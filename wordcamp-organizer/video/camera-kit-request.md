# Camera kit request

If you’re in the US, Europe or Canada, fill the form below and we will ship you camera kits with everything you need.  We’ll confirm your request within a few days.

> **Please note that camera requests made *less than 4 weeks before your camp* may not be fulfilled, due to time constraints**

If your camp is outside of the US, Europe, or Canada, try talking to your local university’s film school to see if they are able to help with your camera needs.
