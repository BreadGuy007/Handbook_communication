# Global Community Sponsorship Program — For Sponsors

This page has information for companies interested in sponsoring WordPress community events through the Global Community Sponsorship program. If you are an event organizer looking for more information about global sponsors or the global community program in general, please check out [Global Community Sponsorship — For Event Organizers](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/planning-details/fundraising/global-community-sponsorship-for-event-organizers/) in the WordCamp Organizing Handbook.

### Sponsoring Community Events

Thanks for your interest in supporting the WordPress community via event sponsorship! We’re so grateful to our sponsors, because without them we couldn’t put on the events that help our community connect and grow.

When you sponsor an official WordPress event, you’re not giving money in exchange for marketing/advertising at the event or with the attendee audience. Sponsorships are donations, given to support the WordPress open source project.

There are two ways to sponsor: through the Global Community program, or through direct sponsorship of individual events.

### **WordPress Global Community Sponsorship in 2016**

One out of every four websites is powered by WordPress, the free and open source software built and maintained by thousands of volunteers all over the world. The WordPress contributor community is made up of developers, designers, writers, photographers, freelancers, agency professionals, and hobbyists, many of whom gather regularly around the world at locally-organized monthly and annual events. Official WordPress community events are exclusively volunteer-organized, and each reflects the interests and expertise of the local community. In 2015, there were 2,016 meetings of official WordPress meetup groups and 89 local annual conferences, which we call [WordCamps](https://central.wordcamp.org/about/).

**What’s a WordCamp?**

WordCamp is the annual conference for local WordPress communities; it’s a casual, non-commercial, educational event about WordPress. Events range from intimate 50-person unconferences to multi-track conferences attended by over 1,000. Conference sessions topics include WordPress development, design, business, social media integration, blogging, and marketing. WordCamp tickets are sold at an extremely low price ($20 per person, per day) so that events are accessible to people of any financial background.

**WordCamp data for 2015:**

*   Total number of WordCamps: 89
*   Number of countries that held at least one WordCamp: 34
*   Total number of unique speakers: 1,677
*   Average number of speakers per WordCamp: 19
*   Total number of unique sessions: 2,135
*   Average number of sessions per WordCamp: 26
*   Total number of unique sponsors: 891
*   Average number of sponsors per WordCamp (includes global sponsors): 8
*   Total number of WordCamp tickets sold: 21,386
*   Average number of attendees per WordCamp: 246

WordCamps confirmed for 2016 can be found [on the official schedule](http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/). Please note that the Global Community Sponsorship program does not include WordCamp Europe or WordCamp US, even though they’re listed on the official schedule.

**What’s a meetup?**

WordPress meetups are locally-organized user groups that get together for face-to-face events on a regular basis to discuss WordPress (commonly once a month). These events take many formats: presentations/lecture series, hackathons, social gatherings, workshops, coworking, running a WordPress help desk, contributor sprints/drives, and others. Groups hosted on meetup.com can join an official WordPress account and receive financial and organizational support from the WordPress Community team.

**WordPress meetup data:**

*   Total number of chapter account/official meetup groups: 197
*   Number of countries with at least one meetup/user group event: 38
*   Average number of groups per country: 4.69
*   Number of groups in the US: 97
*   Total number of group members: 73,183
*   Total number of meetup events: 2,016 (1,377 in the US)

**How does event sponsorship help WordPress?**

Companies that sponsor WordPress community events support the WordPress open source project by helping our volunteer-organized, local events provide free or low-cost access for attendees. WordPress community events strengthen, inspire, and connect the community that builds and maintains WordPress.

**Why sponsor via this program rather than sponsoring individual events?**

As the WordPress community continues to grow, many companies find they don’t have time to coordinate with multiple teams of volunteer event organizers. The WordPress Global Community Sponsorship Program ensures that your support reaches WordCamps and meetups quickly and provides stability to locally-organized events. WordPress global community sponsors have a single, centralized point of contact and are billed quarterly, saving companies time and trouble. Global community sponsors are emailed as soon as each WordCamp is added to the official schedule with all the vital details for the event, including contact info for the organizing team, anticipated number of attendees, mailing address for swag, and more. Global sponsor company information is pre-loaded on every WordCamp website by WordCamp Central, so the local organizing team can publish the sponsor’s logo and company description with one simple click.

**How much does global community sponsorship cost, and what are the benefits?**

The following prices reflect sponsorship for the 2016 calendar year. In 2015, there were 53 WordCamps in the Western region and 34 WordCamps in the Eastern region. We anticipate a 10% increase in events this year, which should result in approximately 100 WordCamps worldwide in 2016.

In the case of WordCamps, each global sponsorship level will be “merged” into the local WordCamp sponsorship levels, and global sponsors will receive the same benefits offered to local sponsors at the same level.

\*Not all WordCamp venues will have space to provide tables to sponsors, but if the venue has enough space to accommodate sponsor tables, then community sponsors will be offered exhibition space. In your notification email, you’ll be informed whether or not the venue has exhibition space so you can request a table right away.

\*\*Free, reserved tickets will return to the general ticket pool if they are not claimed one month before WordCamp. Tickets reserved for sponsors should not be used for ticket giveaways; these are only for your company representatives who wish to attend the event.

**Different rules for sponsor materials:**

For 2016, we’re creating a new corporate subsidiary of the WordPress Foundation to provide legal and financial support to official WordPress community events. This allows us to change some of the rules for event sponsors, since the tax laws for 501(c)3 organizations will no longer restrict us. Here’s how sponsorship rules will change for 2016:

**How will sponsors be billed?**

We’ll bill global sponsors on the first day of every quarter (January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1), and all invoices will be due net 30. Sponsors may not be added to the event program until payment has been received.

The deadline to confirm and pay for sponsorship is 15 days before the beginning of each quarter. Quarterly sponsorship periods are not prorated; if a sponsor joins the program later than 15 days before the beginning of the sponsored quarter, they will not be refunded for events that did not have time to acknowledge their support.

**How do I sign up?**
