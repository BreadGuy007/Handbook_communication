# Your Page on Central.WordCamp.org

Now that your WordCamp is on the calendar we need a bit more information for WordCamp Central. We have these snazzy pages for each WordCamp, and we’d like to include some text for your “About” section.

Here’s an example: [http://central.wordcamp.org/wordcamps/philippines-2012/](http://central.wordcamp.org/wordcamps/philippines-2012/)

Please e-mail us at [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org) with a paragraph or two about your event.

We’re also looking for banner images that highlight the uniqueness of each WordCamp. It can be a photo or illustration, but make sure its something that well represents your WordCamp and its location.

Banner images should be 1852 pixels wide by 320 pixels tall. They’ll be cropped and scaled to some smaller sizes across the site, so please make sure they don’t contain any text or complex imagery that would be lost at a small size.

Here’s what generally makes great banner images:

*   Photos of landscapes or skylines
*   Photos of landmarks or iconic places in your city
*   Horizontal illustrations with bright colors and simple shapes
*   Photos and illustrations that are focused in the center (for optimal cropping)

Here’s what usually makes bad banner images:

*   Anything with text, logos, or symbols
*   Very complex illustrations

Here are a few examples of some good banner images:

New York (A skyline)

Reno (An iconic landmark)

Also, if you haven’t already given us the official address of your venue, please share that with us too.

Thanks so much!
