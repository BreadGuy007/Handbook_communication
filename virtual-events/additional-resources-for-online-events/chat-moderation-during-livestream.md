Chat moderation during livestream

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as we have a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> and expectations for behavior for in-person events in WordPress, we have a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/virtual-events/online-code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> and expectations for behavior for Online events. While the two Codes of Conduct are virtually identical, the way that we enforce them may be pretty different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chat moderation online provides some unique challenges to event organizers. While we have the same basic expectations for attendees in both in-person and on-line events, people are sometimes less likely to followabide by them when they are in a space that feels more anonymous. Additionally, tone and context can be more difficult to understand in online interactions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Participants in official online events are asked to: :&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.</li><li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior and speech.</li><li>Be mindful of your fellow participants. Alert conference organizers if you notice a negative situation or someone in distress.</li><li>Participate in an authentic and active way.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<h2>How to moderate interaction for official WordPress online events</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the event starts, familiarize yourself with the tools for moderating chat and other interactive elements provided by the platform you’re using.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The following behavior should result in an immediate ban: pornographic material, threats, or derogatory comments about someone’s race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, physical appearance, neurodiversity, body size, age, sex,   gender, orientation, religion, caste, or poilitical affiliation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When responding to most other unacceptable behavior during online events, there are three stages:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Stage #1: Warning&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Politely and firmly tell the participant that their behavior was unacceptable, and remind them that this event is a safe, family friendly space. Direct them to the code of conduct if necessary. Let them know that if unacceptable behavior happens again, they might be asked to leave. Whenever possible, it’s best to have this conversation in a private space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Stage #2: Removal</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If unacceptable behavior persists after a warning has been given, remove the participant from the event. The platform you’re using for the meetup event or WordCamp should have tools for this. (Hint: test them before the event starts!)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Stage #3: Banning&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In most circumstances, we prefer not to ban participants. However, if the person has&nbsp; established a pattern of intentionally distracting or abusive behavior and persists in that effort after multiple warnings, then it can be best to ban them. If you have any doubt, reach out to a deputy in the WordPress slack for support.</p>
