# Video Planning

Nearly every local WordPress community includes some people who have cameras and/or skills to operate them. When you’re planning how to video your WordCamp sessions, the first step is to invite your video-minded community members to contribute to WordCamp. Hiring a firm (and adding to your budget) to capture video should be a last resort.

## Before the event

Start by publicizing your desire for a person to join the organizing team to be in charge of video as soon as you’ve nailed down your venue. Identifying one person to be in charge of getting great video early is a great way to keep ahead of the game.

If you need equipment and your event is in the US, Canada or Western Europe, email WordCamp Central. We can loan you a complete kit with everything you need, including an HD camera, tripod, wireless lapel microphone, and cables/adapters. See the full contents of the Foundation Camera Kits [here](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/video/foundation-camera-kit-list/ "See the full contents of the Foundation Camera Kit").

You can also find documentation on this site for [setting up and operating the necessary equipment](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/video/setting-up-your-video-equipment/), whether provided by the Foundation or sourced locally, so volunteers do not need to be professional videographers (though some background in video is obviously a big help).

## During the event

In addition to the video coordinator, you will also need at least one volunteer per camera to monitor the equipment during filming of the presentations. Operating the cameras is not very demanding and will leave the volunteer free to enjoy the presentations they are filming for the most part, so usually it’s easy to find volunteers to help with this job.

## After everyone goes home

If your WordCamp has a Contributor Day, this is a great opportunity to get invite non-coders (or anyone who loves video) to help with [processing, trimming, naming, and uploading files to WordPress.tv](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/video/after-the-event-post-production/). (Mention the opportunity to help with video in your opening/closing remarks so even more people hear about it!) Video expertise is not needed, just a laptop and willingness to learn.

It is also possible to get help from the WordPress.tv moderator squad with post-production of your WordCamp videos. Email WordCamp Central for more info.

## No logos/sponsors in video

Whether you rely on amazing volunteers or end up paying for video, please don’t include sponsor or production company logos in the final videos; WordPress.tv is a non-commercial community site and not a place for advertising.

If you are able to find a local video production company willing to donate their time to filming and producing your WordCamp videos, please address this with them from the beginning. While the adding logos/credits is very common in the film industry (especially for any donated work) it is not a part of videos on WordCamp.tv.
