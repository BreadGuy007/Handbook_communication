# Planning a Contributor Day

You will find the handbook for organising a Contributor Day [over here in the Meetup Organiserâ€™s Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/contributor-day/).

\*Note: If youâ€™re planning to do a Contributor Day as part of your WordCamp, donâ€™t forget to add all the expenses related to the Contributor Day to the preliminary budget before submitting it. If you have any questions, donâ€™t hesitate to ask in the [#community-events](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) channel or to your mentor ðŸ™‚
