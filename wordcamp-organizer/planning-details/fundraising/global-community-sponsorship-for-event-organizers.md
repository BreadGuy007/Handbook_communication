# Global Community Sponsorship — For Event Organizers

> **tl;dr:** Merge 2018 Global Community Sponsors for your event’s region into your local sponsorship levels, with Gold = top level, Silver = second from the top, and Bronze = third from the top; double check that you’ve listed the correct sponsors for your region. Reach out to Global Community Sponsors at the Gold level to offer booth or table space if that will be an option at your WordCamp.

## What is the Global Community Sponsorship program?

Some companies want to support every official WordPress event in the world or in a certain region. To help facilitate this, WordCamp Central administrates the Global Community Sponsorship Program: we bill the sponsors a certain amount every quarter and then distribute the funds based on the financial needs of each meetup, WordCamp, or other official WordPress community event.

## Who are the Global Community Sponsors for 2018?

**As of January 5, 2018, the following Global Community sponsors have signed sponsorship contracts and paid.**

**Western region (The Americas):**

[Jetpack](https://central.wordcamp.org/multi-event-sponsor/jetpack/)  —  Gold  
[WooCommerce](https://central.wordcamp.org/multi-event-sponsor/woocommerce/)  —  Gold  
[Bluehost](https://central.wordcamp.org/multi-event-sponsor/bluehost/)  —  Gold  
[GoDaddy](https://central.wordcamp.org/multi-event-sponsor/godaddy/)  —  Silver

In your budget document, you will see on the Sponsors tab a list of Community Sponsors for your WordCamp’s region. They are also listed in order of contribution level so you can easily see how they correlate to the sponsorship levels you’ve decided on locally. When your Community Sponsorship grant is decided in your budget review, we’ll add that amount to the sponsors tab as well for your quick reference.

Here is a sample budget that contains another list of all the global community sponsors for all the regions (on the Sponsors tab): *https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DKQvoME0hwj4qIt3a6PfU2dpHM-ebxeK-isVXvWqRic/edit?usp=sharing*

\*Not all WordCamp venues will have space to provide tables to sponsors, but if your venue has enough space to accommodate sponsor tables, then community sponsors will be offered exhibition space. In your notification email, you’ll be informed whether or not a WordCamp’s venue has exhibition space so the sponsor can request a table right away.

\*\*Reserved tickets will return to the general ticket pool if they are not claimed one month before WordCamp. Reserved tickets should not be used for ticket giveaways; these are only for the sponsors’ company representatives who wish to attend the event. Number of reserved tickets will vary based on the size of the event and capacity of the venue.

\*\*\*Silver and Bronze global sponsors can “upgrade” to a higher local sponsorship level on individual WordCamps by requesting and paying an invoice for the difference in expense between the desired local sponsorship level and their global sponsorship level, subject to availability, up to 6 weeks before the date of the WordCamp.
