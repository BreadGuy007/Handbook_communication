**do_action is a charity hackathon that uses WordPress to uplift local communities.**

## What is do_action? [#What is do_action?](#what-is-do_action)

do\_action hackathons are community-organised events that are focussed on using WordPress to give deserving charitable organisations their own online presence. Each do\_action event includes participants from the local WordPress community coming together to plan and build brand new websites for a number of local organisations in one day.

The goal of do_action is to support these charitable organisations by giving them a fresh and dynamic online presence. This enables them to get on with the work that they already do so well without basic website management getting in the way of their productivity.

## How do the hackathons work? [#How do the hackathons work?](#how-do-the-hackathons-work)

Each hackathon is organised by members of the local community. Once the non-profit organisations for the day have been chosen, then the sign up form for the event is activated and anyone can sign up to be involved in the event as a participant. Signing up involves selecting the organisation that you would like to work with and then selecting your role on the build team for their website. Each build team has a number of roles available for it, which can vary depending on the needs of the organisation. In general, the available roles are: Project Manager, Designer, Developer (x2), Social Media Manager, Content Manager and Quality Assurance Tester.

Each event will also offer training to the non-profit organisations on how to use WordPress effectively. This empowers them to be able to manage their own websites going forward.

## Where does the name come from? [#Where does the name come from?](#where-does-the-name-come-from)

With do_action being a WordPress-focussed event, it made sense for the name to come from WordPress itself. `do_action` is a function that is used throughout WordPress core and the name of the function really fits with the goal of the events – to allow the non-profits to ramp up their own activity and really get down to business.
