Now that you’ve handled all the big ticket items for the day, there are just a few small tasks that you need to take care of. These are basic things that don’t take too long to do, but are necessary for the day to run smoothly.

Website setups [#Website setups](#website-setups)
-------------------------------------------------

Ideally, you want WordPress to be installed and setup for all of the teams before they arrive in the morning. This means that you will need to have the FTP and database details for each of the non-profits in order to run the WordPress install on their new domains. In some cases, your host may handle this for you, but if they do not then make sure to have it sorted out before the day begins.

Connection details [#Connection details](#connection-details)
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is also important for your teams to all have access to on the morning of the event – the websites may be all setup with WordPress, but the teams will need the domain FTP details as well as the WordPress admin login details. Make sure to have all of that information available for each team. Often the best way to do this is to print out the info for each team and have the printed sheet available on their tables when they arrive.

Name badges [#Name badges](#name-badges)
----------------------------------------

It’s a good idea to have name badges for all of the attendees (non-profit representatives as well as participants). The simplest (and altogether cheapest) way to do that is get sheets of stickers and a few pens so that when people arrive they can write their name on a sticker and stick it on their clothing.

Stationery [#Stationery](#stationery)
-------------------------------------

Aside from the name badges, it’s helpful to have some basic stationery available for the teams. If you can get a notebook and pen for each individual that would be great, but if not then one notebook for each team is also helpful. This gives them a space to sketch designs, plan UI flows, and generally take a few helpful notes. There’s a good chance that one of your sponsors can provide branded notebooks for this, so make sure to chat to them about that.
